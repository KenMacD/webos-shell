# LG WebOS Developer Shell

This shell was built to test the response of luna commands on an LG TV. Itfeatures tab-completion for any luna commands I could find available. The list is likely not exhaustive though.

### Requirements:

 * Set a host named `tv` in your ~/.ssh/config with the properties required to connect

 ### How to run:

 * `python -m webos_shell`
